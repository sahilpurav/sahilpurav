## About
I'm Sahil, working as Associate Director of Engineering in CACTUS. I've been on a gratifying journey with Cactus for the last 5 years, lifting my expertise & experience, working with passionate and delightful people who are full of color. My main focus is on building high-performance team, great products, and high-quality development culture.

I have been spending 10 years of my life in the software industry, helping people and processes to become efficient, automate redundant jobs, and manage a department. I focus on building futuristic products and encourage my team and department to operate with scalability in mind. I like simplifying complex systems by packaging technological advances into friendly experiences. I make open-source contributions in some of the frameworks we use in the organization and own some npm packages and GitHub projects that have healthy downloads.

Off work, I spend my time with family & two lovely felines. I also keep interest in blog writing (technology & finance), astrophysics, traveling, graphic designing, and investing/trading.
